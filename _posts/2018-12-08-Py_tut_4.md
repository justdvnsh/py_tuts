## String And File Manipulation .

__String Manipulation__ is a formatting method for string. Since we know , that Strings are a type of data , thus we need some formatting technique to manipulate it. 

#### Concatenation.  - which is a technique to add two strings together.


```python
str1 = 'Hello'
str2 = 'ABC'

str1 + str2
```




    'HelloABC'



Here we can see that , there is no space , as we haven't added it . To add a space , we need to add a space manually.


```python
str1 + ' ' + str2
```




    'Hello ABC'



Here, we can see that, this method is useful , for shorter texts or strings , but when we have a larger string or text to manipulate, adding spaces, new lines etc can be a very tedious task. Thus we need to have a second option intact, which is __formatting__.

Formatting is just a technique to manipulate the string all at once.


```python
string = 'Hello, my name is {} . And I am here to learn.'
names = ['A','B','c','D','E','F','G','H']

for name in names:
    print(string.format(name))
```

    Hello, my name is A . And I am here to learn.
    Hello, my name is B . And I am here to learn.
    Hello, my name is c . And I am here to learn.
    Hello, my name is D . And I am here to learn.
    Hello, my name is E . And I am here to learn.
    Hello, my name is F . And I am here to learn.
    Hello, my name is G . And I am here to learn.
    Hello, my name is H . And I am here to learn.
    

Here , we can see that, the __format__ function helped us save a lot of time. If we have used the __concatenation__ method , we would have been in trouble as the method was too long and time consuming for the manipulation. 


```python
string = 'Hello my name is {0} and my age is {1}.'
names_and_ages = [
    {
        'name':'A',
        'age': 18
    },
    {
        'name': 'B',
        'age': 19
    },
    {
        'name': 'C',
        'age': 17
    },
    {
        'name': 'D',
        'age': 21
    },
    {
        'name': 'E',
        'age': 22
    }
]

for name_and_age in names_and_ages:
    print(string.format(name_and_age['name'], name_and_age['age']))
```

    Hello my name is A and my age is 18.
    Hello my name is B and my age is 19.
    Hello my name is C and my age is 17.
    Hello my name is D and my age is 21.
    Hello my name is E and my age is 22.
    

In the example above, the __{0} and {1}__ are called __arguments__, of the format method . So, anywhere , where the function will see {0} or {1} it will be replaced by the respective variable value.

But , here is a drawback, that , if you have used {0} and {1} , then the first parameter of the __format__ function will always be used by the {0} and similarly the second one will be used by the {1} . But you can change this behaviour , by naming your arguments by yourself.


```python
string = 'Hello my name is {name_to_be_replaced} and my age is {age}.'
names_and_ages = [
    {
        'name':'A',
        'age': 18
    },
    {
        'name': 'B',
        'age': 19
    },
    {
        'name': 'C',
        'age': 17
    },
    {
        'name': 'D',
        'age': 21
    },
    {
        'name': 'E',
        'age': 22
    }
]

for name_and_age in names_and_ages:
    print(string.format(age=name_and_age['age'], name_to_be_replaced=name_and_age['name']))
```

    Hello my name is A and my age is 18.
    Hello my name is B and my age is 19.
    Hello my name is C and my age is 17.
    Hello my name is D and my age is 21.
    Hello my name is E and my age is 22.
    

Here as, we can see , that using this convention , we made normal arguments into keyword arguments. Now , we can pass the values , howsoever we want.

There is one more method which can be used, and you might remember it from the __SQL__ classes, which is the __%__ method .


```python
string = 'Hello my name is %s. And I love %s !'

names_and_loves = [
    {
        'name':'A',
        'love': 'cricket'
    },
    {
        'name': 'B',
        'love': 'football'
    },
    {
        'name': 'C',
        'love': 'tennis'
    },
    {
        'name': 'D',
        'love': 'Badminton'
    },
    {
        'name': 'E',
        'love': 'Hockey'
    }
]


for name_and_love in names_and_loves:
    print(string %(name_and_love['name'], name_and_love['love']))
```

    Hello my name is A. And I love cricket !
    Hello my name is B. And I love football !
    Hello my name is C. And I love tennis !
    Hello my name is D. And I love Badminton !
    Hello my name is E. And I love Hockey !
    

It is working same as __concat__ or __format__ method . It behaves similarly as the argument passed format method . It as also, accepts the first parameter for the first value , and second one for second value and so on.

If you have to incase print the __%__ sign , you would use the %% sign twice.


```python
print('%%s method is same as %s method and %s method .' %('concat', 'format'))
```

    %s method is same as concat method and format method .
    

Similar to the __%s__ method is the __%f__ method , which prints the float numbers as we want.


```python
print('The 2 decimal places value for PI is %0.2f' %(3))
```

    The 2 decimal places value for PI is 3.00
    


```python
print('The 2 decimal places value for PI is %0.2f' %(3.14))
```

    The 2 decimal places value for PI is 3.14
    


```python
print('The 2 decimal places value for PI is %0.2f' %(3.14526162387346872123))
```

    The 2 decimal places value for PI is 3.15
    


```python
print('The 2 decimal places value for PI is %0.6f' %(3))
```

    The 2 decimal places value for PI is 3.000000
    

the number after 0 decides the decimal places for the value of the floating point number passed in .

#### File Manipulation - which is a technique to manipulate files on a system


```python
file = open('README.md', 'r')
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()
```

    ## Py_tuts
    
    These are basic python tutorials or maybe revision notes for beginners in python programming language. Everyone can access these notes, whenever possible so that ,
    no one is deprived from learning programming. Also, These tuts are basic learningpackage  for machine learning and deep learning.
    


```python
names_and_loves = [
    {
        'name':'A',
        'love': 'cricket'
    },
    {
        'name': 'B',
        'love': 'football'
    },
    {
        'name': 'C',
        'love': 'tennis'
    },
    {
        'name': 'D',
        'love': 'Badminton'
    },
    {
        'name': 'E',
        'love': 'Hockey'
    }
]

file = open('new_file.txt', 'w')
for name_and_love in names_and_loves:
    file.write(name_and_love['name'])
    file.write('\t')
    file.write(name_and_love['love'])
    file.write('\n')
file.close()
```

Here if , you see , using the __w__ method , we will find that , the old content gets lost and only the new content remains. If we do not want this , we should use the __a+__ method.


```python
file = open('new_file.txt', 'a+')
for name_and_age in names_and_ages:
    file.write(name_and_age['name'])
    file.write('\t')
    file.write(str(name_and_age['age']))
    file.write('\n')
file.close()
```

contents of the file -:

A	cricket

B	football

C	tennis

D	Badminton

E	Hockey

A	18

B	19

C	17

D	21

E	22


One more thing to note is that , we need to everytime close the file when we open it. This can cause bug , and some resources. To avoid that , python provides us with beautiful method , called __with__ keyword.


```python
with open('new_file.txt', 'r') as file:
    print(file.read())
```

    A	cricket
    B	football
    C	tennis
    D	Badminton
    E	Hockey
    A	18
    B	19
    C	17
    D	21
    E	22
    
    

You can use this method , to do any kind of file manipulation, and not worry about closing the file everytime.
