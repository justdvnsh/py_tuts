#### Functions 

Let's get a bit mathematical here. A __function__ is anything that takes in an input or a set of inputs , and then provides a single value. Single value is something to keep a note of , because any function that provides more than one output is not considered a pure function. 

For example, 

f(x) = 4x^2 + 5x + 7

In here , as we can see ,  that f(x) is a function of x , where all the values which can be inserted into x i.e. input for the functions is called the __domain__ of the function . Like here, all the real numbers __R__ is the domain of the function. Similarly , this funciton , for one particular value of x will provide only one particular output, thus it is a pure function . A pure quaratic function, where the graph of the function would be a parabola on the +ve y-axis , with an intercept of 4.

Now, all the values which the function will produce will be called the range of the function , which in this case is all the +ve numbers till infinity.

The  same concept applies into the computer science, term __function__ . It is anything , that takes in a value and then provides a particular value for a given input or a set of inputs. Now the paradigm of programming with only the use of pure functions is called __functional programming__ .

Pure functions are any functions , which - 

- For any given input provide only one particular output

- Are not dependent on the outer scope of the environment context, i.e. the global variables.

Functions are defined using a reserved keyword __def__ , which ironically stands for __define__, i.e. define a function. 

A normal function is defined as -

def __name-of-the-function__(arguments,if,any):
    ## your process or code to do some task
    


```python
def add_ten():
    print(12 + 10)
```


```python
add_ten()
```

    22
    

if you have not used the __return__ keyword , python will not stop the command from running and keep the function intact.


```python
def add_ten():
    print(12 + 10)
    print('Hey I am still runnning')
```


```python
add_ten()
```

    22
    Hey I am still runnning
    


```python
def add_ten():
    return 10 + 12
    print('Hey I am not running')
```


```python
add_ten()
```




    22



arguments are just variables which are limited to the functions context. i.e. those variables can only be accessed inside of the function .


```python
age = 18

def eligible_to_vote():
    return 10 + age

eligible_to_vote()
```




    28




```python
age = 20

def eligible_to_vote(candidates_age):
    print(candidates_age)
    return 10 + candidates_age

eligible_to_vote(age)
```

    20
    




    30




```python
print(age)
```

    20
    


```python
print(candidates_age)
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-65-9e7c62b7dc7c> in <module>()
    ----> 1 print(candidates_age)
    

    NameError: name 'candidates_age' is not defined


If you still have the __chull__ to make the argument globally accessible , you can use the __global__ keyword.


```python
age = 20

def eligible_to_vote(candidates_age):
    print(candidates_age)
    return 10 + candidates_age

eligible_to_vote(age)
print(age)
print('\n')
print(candidates_age)
```

    20
    20
    
    
    


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-66-637dd24445cc> in <module>()
          8 print(age)
          9 print('\n')
    ---> 10 print(candidates_age)
    

    NameError: name 'candidates_age' is not defined



```python
age = 20 ## global scope ka var

def eligible_to_vote(candidates_age):
    x = 10 ## local scope ka var
    return x + candidates_age

eligible_to_vote(age)
print(x)
```

    13
    

here we are not able to print x since , it is not defined outside of the function, therefore it has a local scope . 


```python
age = 20

def eligible_to_vote(candidates_age):
    global x
    x = 13
    return 10 + candidates_age

eligible_to_vote(age)
print(x)
```

    13
    

A function can take as many arguments as possible. but many of the time, a function is not aware of the number of arguments, thus we use the __*arg__ keyword


```python
def function_with_too_many_arguments(*arg):
    print(arg)
    
function_with_too_many_arguments(12)
```

    (12,)
    


```python
function_with_too_many_arguments(12,23)
```

    (12, 23)
    


```python
function_with_too_many_arguments(12,32, 'hello', (12,34), [1,2,3,4,5,6])
```

    (12, 32, 'hello', (12, 34), [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    

Using the __*arg__ keyword ,  you can pass as many arguments as you wish. Now every argument should not have a mandatory regulation. Thus we use some arguments with default values.


```python
def func_with_default(number):
    return number
```


```python
func_with_default()
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-73-7d7b9d0c9c60> in <module>()
    ----> 1 func_with_default()
    

    TypeError: func_with_default() missing 1 required positional argument: 'number'


This is because , we have called the function without any arguments, which are compulsory to be provided in order to run .


```python
func_with_default(0)
```




    0




```python
def func_with_default(number = 10):
    return number
```


```python
func_with_default()
```




    10




```python
func_with_default(200)
```




    200



This is used, when some argument is not compulsory to be provided by the user. Thus it accepts a default value. 

Now , if we have a similar case of unknown arguments , with their keys, then we use the __**kwarg__ keyword , which stands for, keyword argument.


```python
def func_with_default(**kwargs):
    print(kwargs)
```


```python
func_with_default()
```

    {}
    


```python
func_with_default(arg1 = None)
```

    {'arg1': None}
    


```python
func_with_default(arg1 = 10, arg2 = 20, arg3 = 30)
```

    {'arg1': 10, 'arg2': 20, 'arg3': 30}
    

A condition to make a function pure is that  , it depends on a single input, and local vars. Thus to make a function pure, we use a method called __currying__ .

Currying is nothing but , a simple method to break many arguments into one single function.


```python
def add_two_values(x,y): ## impure function
    return x + y
```


```python
add_two_values(10,20)
```




    30




```python
## currying used function.
def add_two_values(x):
    def second_value(y):
        return x + y
    return second_value
```


```python
add_two_values(10)(10)
```




    20




```python
val_one = add_two_values(10)
val_one
```




    <function __main__.add_two_values.<locals>.second_value(y)>




```python
val_one(10)
```




    20



Here, we will see that , the functions are broken into simpler form, using the currying method. First, the __add_two_values__ function takes in a value , and then , stores it in the x var , and then calls the second function, which is defined inside the main function. The local function gets called with the second value passed in and then , it finally returns the added value, the final output. These functions , which call other functions are called __high-order-functions__ or __callback-functions__ .
