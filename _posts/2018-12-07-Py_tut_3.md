## Conditionals and Loops

__Conditionals__ , are used whenever , we want our program to make decisions . Using conditinals like __if,else__ gives the program the ability to make decisions based on the rules we provide it.

For example , if we want our program to only allow users to vote if they are above 18, we use conditionals.


```python
age = int(input('Enter your age :- ')) ## remember , input always returns a string . So keep in mind to convert the integer 
#input to integer.

def eligible_to_vote(age):
    if age >= 18:
        return 'eligible to vote.'
    else:
        return 'Not eligible'
    
eligible_to_vote(age)
```

    Enter your age :- 20
    




    'eligible to vote.'



Similarly , we can have as many cases as we want using __elif__ keyword.

Lets say , we want to make a program , to sell candy to only boys below age 10 , sell chocolates to only boys from 11 - 17 and cigarettes to 18 and above .


```python
age = int(input('Enter your age , boy :- '))

def sell(age):
    if age <= 10 :
        return 'Candy'
    elif age >= 11 and age <= 17:
        return 'Chocolcates'
    else:
        return 'Cigarettes'
    
sell(age)
```

    Enter your age , boy :- 20
    




    'Cigarettes'



Now, we can have as many __elif__ conditions as we want.

__Loops__ are used when we want to iterate over something. They can also be used to make the repetetive tasks smaller and efficient, passing the email to 100 clients or maybe writing something over and over again.

There are 3 main loops , __for__ being the most popular one .

Lets say we want to print tables from 1 to 10 , we can use loops



```python
table = int(input('Enter the number:-'))

def print_table(table):
    for x in range(1,11): ## since 11 is not included
        print(table * x)
    
print_table(table)
```

    Enter the number:-10
    10
    20
    30
    40
    50
    60
    70
    80
    90
    100
    

Similarly, we have __while__ loop, which is used when we do not know when the condition is going to end. While loops are most common in game developement, because , a program cannot have the idea , when the user is going to quit, or die.

Lets say we want to make a program to keep taking in the input , till the user keeps saying yes.


```python
def yes(inp):
    while inp == 'yes':
        inp = input('Enter your input')

yes(input('Enter your input:-'))
```

    Enter your input:-yes
    Enter your inputyes
    Enter your inputno
    

There are 2 more important keywords , __break__ and __continue__, which as the name suggests , the __break__ keyword, breaks the loop and __continue__ keyword, leaves the value at the spot and continues from the next value.


```python
for x in range(1,11):
    if x == 5:
        break
    else:
        print(x)
```

    1
    2
    3
    4
    


```python
for x in range(1,11):
    if x == 5:
        continue
    else:
        print(x)
```

    1
    2
    3
    4
    6
    7
    8
    9
    10
    

Range() , function can also be used with 3 values/ arguments , that are -

- First is the value you want to start from

- Second is the value you want to end at

- Third is the value , you want to skip to.


```python
for i in range(1,21,2):
    print(i)
```

    1
    3
    5
    7
    9
    11
    13
    15
    17
    19
    

You can also , use loops to iterate over files , or different types of data-structures. Like you can iterate over dictionaries or lists or tuples.


```python
lis = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
dic = {
    'name': 'abc',
    'age': 19,
    'gender': None
}
tup = (12,13,14,15)

for i in lis:
    print(i)
    
for i in dic:
    print(i)
    
for i in tup:
    print(i)
```

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    name
    age
    gender
    12
    13
    14
    15
    

In the example above , the loop iterates over the __keys__ of the dictionary and not the values because , you can access the values using the keys .
