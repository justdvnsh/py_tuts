## Programming

#### Static vs Dynamic Programming language

Static is a language where , we need to define the content explicitly .
cpp -> int age = 18
cpp -> string age = '18'

Dynamic is a language where , you do not need to define the content explicitly.
python -> age = 18 ; age = '18'

##### Compiled vs Interpreted Languages

Compiled languages are those , which are executed directly by the machine.
ex -> cpp

Interpreted langauges are those , which are read and executed line by line.
ex-> python

## Data types 

int -> -ve to +ve values .

string -> 'absdakahjgdskas dbkjah 18 aksjbdkasjdb !!@*(#^!(@*#&!(@*#&'

float -> decimal values. -1 -> -1.00

double -> decimal values . 

#### variables

Can be considered as containers or storage boxes which hold any type of value.

eg -> age = 18.00

#### Constants

Values which remain constant throughout the execution time. 



```python
age = 18 
```


```python
age
```




    18




```python
age = 19
age
```




    19




```python
AGE = 18 
AGE
```




    18




```python
CONST = 12

def add(val1):
    return val1 + CONST

def add_2(val1):
    return val1 + CONST

def add_3(val1):
    return val1 + CONST

def add_4(val1):
    return val1 + CONST

add(12)
```




    24



#### Keywords

values which cannnot be used as vars or const.

int , str, input, def 

#### Data Structures

Lists/Arrays
Dictionaries/Objects
Tuples

1) Lists. - A data structure which can hold many value and is mutable.

age = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, 'hello', 'goodbye', 1.00, 9.00]


```python
age =  ['hello',2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, 'hello', 'goodbye', 1.00, 9.00]
age
```




    ['hello', 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 'hello', 'goodbye', 1.0, 9.0]




```python
age[0]
```




    'hello'




```python
age[1]
```




    2




```python
age[0] = 'hello ashwin'
age[0]
```




    'hello ashwin'




```python
age
```




    ['hello ashwin', 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 'hello', 'goodbye', 1.0, 9.0]




```python
## (0,1) [1,10] [1,10)
age_2 = age[1:10]
age_2
```




    [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]




```python
greetings = age[0]
greetings_2 = age[10:12]
new_greetings = [greetings, greetings_2]
```


```python
new_greetings
```




    ['hello ashwin', ['hello', 'goodbye']]




```python
new_greetings[1][0]
```




    'hello'




```python
len(new_greetings)
```




    2




```python
greet = ['hello ashwin', ['hello', 'goodbye']]
```


```python
print(greet == new_greetings)
```

    True
    


```python
greet[0] = 'hello'
```


```python
new_greetings
```




    ['hello ashwin', ['hello', 'goodbye']]




```python
greet
print(greet == new_greetings)
```

    False
    

#### Operators

+ -> add
- -> subtract
* -> mul

/ -> divide

% -> module/remainder

= -> assignment

== -> comparison

=== -> identical

!= -> not equal

!== -> not identical


```python
1 + 2
```




    3




```python
2 - 1
```




    1




```python
2 / 2
```




    1.0




```python
2 // 2
```




    1




```python
3 / 2
```




    1.5




```python
3 // 2
```




    1




```python
2 * 2
```




    4




```python
3 % 2
```




    1




```python
number = 10.0
number_2 = 10.0

print(number != number_2)
```

    False
    

#### Tuples

Same as lists , with only one difference. They are unmutable unlike lists.


```python
tup1 = (1,2)
```


```python
tup1[0]
```




    1




```python
tup1[1]
```




    2




```python
tup1[0] = 'hello'
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-53-64dcc0b3bf40> in <module>()
    ----> 1 tup1[0] = 'hello'
    

    TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment



```python
tup2 = (40)
```


```python
tup2
```




    40




```python
type(tup2)
```




    int




```python
tup2 = (40,'hello', greet)
```


```python
type(tup2)
```




    tuple




```python
tup2
```




    (40, 'hello', ['hello', ['hello', 'goodbye']])



#### Dictionary


```python
name_and_age = {'ashwin': 18, 'mehul': 18, 'divyansh_and_hemant': (17,18), 'rest_of_them': [18,18,18]}
```


```python
name_and_age
```




    {'ashwin': 18,
     'mehul': 18,
     'divyansh_and_hemant': (17, 18),
     'rest_of_them': [18, 18, 18]}




```python
name_and_age['ashwin']
```




    18




```python
name_and_age['ashwin'] = 19
```


```python
name_and_age
```




    {'ashwin': 19,
     'mehul': 18,
     'divyansh_and_hemant': (17, 18),
     'rest_of_them': [18, 18, 18]}




```python
name_and_age['rest_of_them'][0] = 19
```


```python
name_and_age['rest_of_them'][0]
```




    19




```python
type(name_and_age)
```




    dict
